        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Prepare the Filling:</h3>
            <p>
              - Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan over medium heat.<br />
              - Add minced garlic and grated ginger. Sauté for a minute until
              fragrant.<br />

              vegetables.<br />
              - Add soy sauce, green chili sauce, vinegar, black pepper powder,
              and salt. Mix everything thoroughly and cook for a few more
              minutes. The filling should be well-seasoned and flavorful.<br />
              - Turn off the heat and let the filling cool down a bit. Add
              chopped cilantro and mix.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Assemble the Spring Rolls:</h3>
            <p>
              - Take a spring roll wrapper and place it on a clean surface in a
              diamond shape (one corner facing you).<br />
              - Place a spoonful of the paneer and vegetable filling near the
              bottom corner of the wrapper.<br />
              - Fold the bottom corner over the filling and roll it up tightly
              halfway.<br />
              - Fold the sides of the wrapper towards the center.<br />
              - Continue rolling the wrapper upwards, making sure it's tightly
              wrapped. Use a mixture of all-purpose flour and water to seal the
              edges of the wrapper.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>

            <p>
              - Heat oil in a deep frying pan or wok over medium heat. The oil
              should be hot but not smoking.<br />
              - Carefully place the sealed spring rolls into the hot oil, seam
              side down.<br />
              - Fry until they turn golden brown and crispy on all sides. Make
              sure to turn them gently for even frying.<br />
              - Once fried, remove the spring rolls from the oil and place them
              on a paper towel-lined plate to remove excess oil.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Serve:</h3>
